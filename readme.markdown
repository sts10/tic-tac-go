# Tic Tac Go

I'm writing a command line tic-tac-toe game as I try to learn Golang! It seems to work OK as of this writing.

## Some Notes on My Plan

To check for a winner, I'm using a second array called `sums` that adds up each of the possible wins in the game of tic-tac-toe. (Fun fact: I used this idea (and drew the sketch below) back in 2013 as part of my admission test to The Flatiron School.)

## Blog Post 

**Here is [a long blog post I wrote about making this little game](https://sts10.github.io/2017/11/18/trying-go-and-rust.html)**, first in Golang, then in [Rust](https://github.com/sts10/rusty-tac).

## Where I've Been Learning Go From

[This great YouTube video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CF9S4QZuV30&feature=youtu.be) as well as ["A Tour of Go"](https://tour.golang.org).

If you have other resources-- especially for those coming from dynamic type languages like Ruby (oh, sweet, sweet Ruby)-- that you think would help me (or others), feel free to file an issue or [hit me up on Mastodon](https://octodon.social/@schlink)!
